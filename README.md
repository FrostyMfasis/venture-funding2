Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked me to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I decided to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become successful. In order to predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, I will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network. This project consisted of three technical deliverables:

*Preprocessing data for a neural network model.
*Using the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
*Optimizing the model.
